## Archive

This folder contains files that are kept for reference but are **not part of the active site**.

### Why this exists

- Keep the active repo surface area small and easier to maintain.
- Preserve older experiments/notes without deleting them.
- Avoid accidentally shipping legacy artifacts into production or DEV builds.

### What moved (high level)

#### `archive/legacy/`
- **Worker examples**: `worker-example.js`, `worker-complete.js`
- **Old UI test page**: `tee-time-decision-test.html`

These are not referenced by `/dev` or production HTML and were kept for reference only.

#### `archive/notes/`
- `WORKER_ANALYSIS.md`
- `GOLFCOURSEAPI_FIELDS.md`
- `MOBILE_FIRST_IDEAS.md`

These documents are useful historical notes but are not required to run the current static GitHub Pages app.
